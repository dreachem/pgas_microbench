PGAS Microbenchmarks

These contains a set of simple microbenchmarks for various PGAS libraries and
languages.


TESTS:

----------------------------------------------
PUT Bandwidth Test:

PUT M-sized message N times.

Bandwidth =  M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------
GET Bandwidth Test

GET M-sized message N times.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------
Latency Test:

PUT small message to target address and then GET from target address N times.

Latency = (t2 - t1) / N

-----------------------------------------------

PUT Duplex Bandwidth Test:

Pair of processes PUT M-sized message N times to eachother.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)    (take average)

-----------------------------------------------

GET Duplex Bandwidth Test:

Pair of processes GET M-sized message N times to eachother.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)    (take average)
