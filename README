HPCTools PGAS Microbenchmark Suite
------------------------------------

These contains a set of simple microbenchmarks for various PGAS libraries and
languages, as well as for MPI.

All the latency and bandwidth tests use communicating pairs. Therefore, these
tests require an even number of processes to be launched. For N processes, the
communicating pairs are { (1,N/2+1), ... , (N/2-1,N) }. The user decides how
many processes to launch and the mapping of processes to the processors on the
system.

Also included, for some models, are AllReduce tests. These involve all
processes in a sum-to-all reduction. This is currently available for CAF,
SHMEM, GASNet, and MPI.


Description of Tests.

-----------------------------------------------
Put-Get Latency Test:

PUT small message to target address and then GET from target address N times.

Latency = (t2 - t1) / N

-----------------------------------------------
Put-Put Latency Test:

PUT small message to target address, synchronize with target, and then wait
for partner to do the same to me. Do this N times.

Latency = (t2 - t1) / N

-----------------------------------------------
Get-Get Latency Test:

GET small message to target address, synchronize with target, and then wait
for partner to do the same to me. Do this N times.

Latency = (t2 - t1) / N

----------------------------------------------
PUT Bandwidth Test:

PUT M-sized message N times.

Bandwidth =  M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------
GET Bandwidth Test

GET M-sized message N times.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------

PUT Bidirectional Bandwidth Test:

Pair of processes PUT M-sized message N times to eachother.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)    (take average)

-----------------------------------------------

GET Bidirectional Bandwidth Test:

Pair of processes GET M-sized message N times to eachother.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)    (take average)

-----------------------------------------------

Strided PUT Bandwidth Test:

PUT fixed-sized (size M) message to target with stride S, N times

Bandwidth =  M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------

Strided GET Bandwidth Test:

GET fixed-sized (size M) message from target with stride S, N times

Bandwidth =  M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------

Random Put Bandwidth Test:

PUT message of size M to random address at random target N times.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------

Random Get Bandwidth Test:

GET message of size M from random address at random target N times.

Bandwidth = M*N / (t2 - t1)

-----------------------------------------------

Reduction Test:

- Reduction message of size M to non-overlapping target, N times

- Reduction message of size M to same src buffer, N times
